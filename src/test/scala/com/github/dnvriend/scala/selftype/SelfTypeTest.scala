  /**
   * ==Overview==
   * The self type annotation allows you to split a trait in two but still refer to things on the second trait as
   * though they are defined in the first trait, requiring they are mixed in together.
   *
   * The self type annotation allows you to express a dependency within a trait, a dependency that when satisfied
   * allows one trait to make use of code defined in a separate trait.
   *
   * What's the difference from extending a class? Extends is actually extending it and is very type specific.
   * The self type annotation is just declaring that this type needs to extend / implement the annotated type,
   * but it doesn't extend it yet. It lets you ''inject'' the extension, thus supports dependency injection.
   *
   * You can use any identifier for the self type annotation, eg. ''self'' or ''this'' or ''scalaIsGreat'', which
   * according to Martin Odersky on the question ''Is there any real difference between using this or self or foo as the
   * name for the identifier of the self type annotation?''
   *
   * All three forms are valid, and have the effect that B is assumed as the type of this in class A. The variants
   *
   * {{{
   *  trait A { self: B => ... }
   *  trait A { foo: B => ... }
   * }}}
   *
   * introduce self (respectively, foo) as an alias for this in trait A. This is useful for accessing the this reference
   * from an inner class. I.e. you could then use self instead of A.this when accessing the this reference of the trait A
   * from a class nested within it. The third variant,
   *
   * {{{
   * trait A { this: B => ... }
   * }}}
   *
   * does not introduce an alias for this; it just sets the self type.
